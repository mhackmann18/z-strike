# Z-Strike

I made this little web game with basic JS, HTML, and CSS about a year ago when I first started learning web-development. The code is pretty ugly, but I 
figured I'd go ahead and put it on here just to show how my coding style has improved from then to now. Most of the work for this project was really logic-
heavy, and I spent most of my time figuring out how to get the avatar to respond to player input, as well as handling the interaction between the player and
the zombies. Playing the game is really simple, just use WASD to move your avatar and point and click to shoot zombies. The goal is to simply get the highest score
you can without dying.
